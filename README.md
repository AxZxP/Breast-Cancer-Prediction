## Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repo should be considered as a simple illustration of a training session on a *toy* dataset to visualize what would be an optimal methodology to :
- Quick transformation of numerical features
- Select an algorithm by cross-validating the test
- Reduce de dimensionnality of a dataset
- Hypertuning a Linear Discrimant Analysis

### Usage
This work can be looked at a good way to improve ML practices, nothing more.
